# Fire damage map

Web map containing fire damage information for every land lot.
Area of interest is 0.25 km2 located in Croatan county Split-Dalmatia. In 2017 there was a big fire that destroyed many residential and agricultural areas.
This map only covers very small portion of that, but serves as prototype for developing fire damage assessment system that will mostly benefit people whose land was affected by the fire.
